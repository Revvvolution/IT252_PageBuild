	<p>
		FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham is assigned to the bureau&#8217;s Fringe Division, in which she investigates unusual crimes and occurrences. Assisting Olivia in her investigations are once-institutionalized scientist Dr. Walter Bishop, his jack-of-all-trades son, Peter, and FBI Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth. As the team investigates cases of science gone awry, they discover connections to their own past and to a parallel universe. As the team solves cases in these interconnected worlds, new discoveries and complications continue to arise.

		Created by J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci, Fringe has been described as a hybrid of fantasy, procedural dramas and serials, featuring mystery-of-the-week episodes as well as an overarching theme to it's mythology. Although the series earned some low ratings, it developed a cult following. In addition, many of the show's cast and crew were nominated for various awards. Fringe also spawned two six-part comic book series, an alternate reality game, and three novels.
